# Useradd command will add new user to the system 
-- name: hossam 
-- Group : hossam 
-- home : /home

# Let's understand what is prmissions in linux
# if you try to get into file or read file and you don't have permission to do that 
# you will face this problem Permission denied
! try this with me 
# mkdir with permission red only
+ mkdir denied && chmod u=r , g=r , o=r denied

# now let's try to get into this file 
+ cd denied
# it will show this  Permission denied 
```

```diff
# now let's understand what just happen

! r > read
! w > write
! x > execute
! u > user permission
! g > group permission
! o > other permission

! chmod [OPTION] [MODE]  [FILE]
# give permission execute to   denied  directory excute  permission
+ chmod u+x denied/

# now you can  get in to directory
```

</p>

```diff
! useing = mean that you wnat give this permission only for user and group and other
+ chmod u+rw,g-r,o=r denied 

! useing - mean that you wnat remove this permission  from user and group and other
+ chmod u-r,g-r,o-r denied 

! useing + mean that you wnat add this permission  for user and group and other
+ chmod u+r,g+r,o+r denied

 - #### Linux processes!! 
##### 

```diff
# To track the running processes on your machine you can use the top command.
- top | htop
PID: Unique Process ID given to each process.
User: Username of the process owner.
PR: Priority given to a process while scheduling.
NI: ‘nice’ value of a process.
VIRT: Amount of virtual memory used by a process.
RES: Amount of physical memory used by a process.
SHR: Amount of memory shared with other processes.
S: state of the process
‘D’ = uninterruptible sleep
‘R’ = running
‘S’ = sleeping
‘T’ = traced or stopped
‘Z’ = zombie

# s short for ‘Process Status’. It displays the currently-running processes. However, unlike the top command, the output generated is not in realtime.
- ps
 
# To get more information using ps command use:

 ps -u hos
